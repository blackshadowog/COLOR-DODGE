ðŸš€ Project Launch: Color Dodge Reflexes ðŸŽ®
Iâ€™m excited to share Color Dodge Reflexes â€” a fast-paced, color-switching reflex game built using modern web technologies (hosted on Netlify).
ðŸ”„ Switch colors, dodge barriers, and test your reflexes in a dynamic, rhythm-based environment
ðŸŽ¨ Clean visual design with vibrant color contrasts to keep the player engaged
ðŸ’¡ Lightweight and responsive â€” built to perform smoothly across devices
This project gave me a chance to dive deeper into real-time rendering, input handling, and performance optimization in a browser environment.
